	The business rules for the refresh state that it should not run
	before 8 pm, if delayed by a running close on admin.  The refresh
	is currently waiting until 8 pm, close flag file is gone from admin.


	This is actually a problem -- the regular refresh will run again at
	9:30 pm.  If one refresh is already running when another one starts,
	oracle3 database will be corrupted.  

	Please contact the DBA's and unixgroup.  The best thing to do at this
	point is probably to delete the rest of this oracle3 refresh chain
	from the admsrv appworx backlog, and allow the regular refresh to run
	later on today.
